Uber教(Uberism)

#引子

Uber教，又稱Uber主義，是一種鼓勵他人對你的雇主、老師或家長寄送評價的做法，不論評價是正面還是負面，以此來使他人的意見和情緒得以抒發。
這種做法可以應用於各種場合，例如當你剛開始一份新工作時，你可以告訴他人，歡迎他們向你的上司評價你。
同樣地，當你在學校時，你可以鼓勵他人通過電子郵件對你的導師或家長提供反饋或意見。
此外，如果有人對你的行為不當，你可以向他們的上司或老師評價。

#Introduction

Uberism refers to the practice of encouraging others to leave reviews to your employer, teacher, or parents, whether positive or negative, as a means of holding them accountable. This practice can be applied in various settings, such as when starting a new job, attending school, or dealing with difficult individuals. For instance, upon starting a new job, you can inform others that they are welcome to leave a review for you to your boss. Similarly, at school, you can encourage others to email your teacher or parents with any feedback or concerns. Additionally, if someone is mistreating you, you can write a review of their behavior to their employer or teacher.
